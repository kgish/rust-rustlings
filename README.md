# Rust Rustlings

My attempt to tackle the rustlings exercises in order to learn the Rust programming language better.

## Setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
$ cd rustlings
$ git checkout tags/2.1.0
$ cargo install --force --path .
```
# Start the exercises.

```bash
$ rustlings watch
```

Keep going until there are no more errors.
